Conclusions based on the data:

1.	The test group was evenly selected with a slightly higher amount of males over female mice and 25 mice per drug regimen with the exceptions of Propriva and Stelasyn.
2.	Capomulin was largely successful at reducing the tumor volume in mice over time.
3.	For the group using Capomulin, results showed that the heavier the mouse the larger the volume of the tumor on average.
